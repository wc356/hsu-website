  body: [
    "The ability to tell a story and make a statement through music is one way in which individuals can express their personal opinions. As a professional musician, it is my mission to provide students with knowledge of technical, musical, historical, and expressive elements that will allow them to share their unique ideas with the world. My goal as a teacher is to allow my students to develop an understanding of the history behind each piece that they learn and provide a variety of methods that will allow them to tell their own story. Beginner students will learn practice techniques and exercises that will help them create beautiful sounds that evoke different personalities from their instrument. Advanced students will continue to work on fundamental exercises and experiment with a variety of ways to create different emotions and express different ideas through their playing. My main artistic focus is to enable students to create their own distinctive interpretations.",
    "Weekly private lessons will be individually tailored based on each students‚Äô interests and goals. I encourage students to explore their own independent musical ideas and be committed to their expressions. As a mentor, I will strengthen my students‚Äô confidence and self-motivation as musicians and as individuals. Lessons will primarily be focused on technique exercises, polishing repertoire, and expanding students‚Äô knowledge. I will cultivate curiosity and support students in accomplishing short-term and long-term goals.",
    "Through bi-weekly studio classes, all students will be a part of an inspiring session in which they will perform for each other and provide honest and positive feedback. Students in my studio will encourage and motivate each other to become well-rounded musicians. Studio class will also consist of lectures, presentations, and group discussions.",
    "I strongly advocate for a comprehensive knowledge of analysis and historical knowledge of repertoire that students learn because it allows them to evaluate and understand the music on a deeper level. Knowing the historical context in which a piece was composed and what the composer was going through at that time enables students to understand the music on a personal level with which they can connect. It also encourages them to be creative in their own approach to the music. Additionally, understanding the music theory and analysis of the piece will help students to formulate an educated decision on musical expressions and sound quality they want to create based on the harmonies.",
    "As an avid chamber musician, I strongly encourage my students to collaborate amongst each other and with our studio pianist through opportunities that arise outside of the studio. Collaborating with other musicians allows students to develop strong listening skills and fosters strong verbal and musical communication skills. Yearly studio recitals provide students with an opportunity to perform solo and collaborative pieces that they have been working on.",
    "I believe it is my responsibility to cultivate a trusting teacher-student relationship that encourages students to become lifelong learners. The overall goal of my teaching philosophy is to support students throughout their musical journey.",

        "There will never be a time in which one won‚Äôt hear the opening of the Bartok Concerto, Brahms F minor sonata, the dreaded opening octave of Der Schwanendreher, the dreaded 16th passage from the Walton Concerto movement 1, and more, in practice rooms as you walk down the hallway for the 5th time because of course, there aren‚Äôt any rooms available; or on the streets from an open window in an apartment as you walk home. Everyone seems to be learning the same repertoire--and yes, there is only so much standard viola repertoire, but why not explore more!",
        "I came across a few of these pieces around 2 years ago from Tabea Zimmermann‚Äôs album and did implement a few of them in my yearly recitals but always wanted more. Given the current situation, I decided to indulge in these hidden gems. The first prototype of my ‚Äúgems‚Äù project was so difficult. I first tried to plan out what concepts would be important in virtually collaborating--which in it‚Äôs own sense consists of different elements. Since live virtual collaboration is difficult with modern technology, not to mention varying internet connections and quality of equipment. Much of video conferencing microphones are geared towards speech and enunciation, but do not fare well for instrumentalists with the same resources. With this in mind, recording live was not an option.",
        "I decided not to dwell too much on details and to immediately jump in and begin the process of trial and error. I recorded an audio file of me just schenkerian counting the whole first movement of Vierne‚Äôs Op. 5 piece. I then recorded a video of me playing just the viola part--keeping in mind the accompaniment phrasing and rhythms. I sent it to my amazing collaborator, and received feedback. She then sent trial video recordings of solely the accompaniment part. After receiving it and playing with the recording a few times, I gave feedback on elements that I would like which she implemented immediately and sent the final prototype edition. I then recorded along with the accompaniment video.",
        "Recording with an existing video straight-through was so difficult and draining. I always felt blessed and grateful to have live accompaniment when I did have it, but with the current situation I feel even more indebted to them on a deeper level. The ability to connect and collaborate in person is something we all relate to, even non-musicians. Being able to be spontaneous is something I love to do musically, and recording with a preexisting recording didn‚Äôt allow me to do that. Instead, I found myself in the role of a follower, which all you chamber musicians know, is the worst thing you can possibly do. It‚Äôs called a collaboration for a reason. And yes, we did communicate, but through words. In my opinion, I‚Äôm a huge believer in the thought of music being indescribable in words. To me, words aren‚Äôt enough. And in this context, words and recordings of how each of us feels the music, is all we have.",
        "With all that aside, I had a wonderful experience working on this ‚ÄúHidden Gems‚Äù project of mine, and I look forward to a time where we can all collaborate in person together. Enjoy~ üéµ",
