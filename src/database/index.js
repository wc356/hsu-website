    body: [
      "There are many different ways of approaching new repertoire. Is this music for an upcoming recital? Jury? Audition? Or something you’re learning for fun? So many reasons lead to different approaches due to time restraints, whether they’re in our favor or not. How we approach our learning process relies largely on our mindset. Even if it’s for pure enjoyment, do you consciously set aside that time to play around? Or do you prioritize upcoming performances even if the program consists of repertoire you don’t particularly enjoy practicing? It’s all a question of how we address time.",
      "For example, I have auditions approaching relatively soon (early next year), and the motivation to really focus on the set of repertoire for those auditions have been consistently alternating on and off throughout the summer thus far. In this case, a constant reminder of my long term goals is crucial. I’ve found that constantly balancing the mindset of revisiting my long term goal while also focusing on going about my days one day at a time and enjoying the process rather than stressing out over that end goal, is very important. Of course that’s easier said than done. It’s daily trial and error. During my time quarantined back home in the suburbs of Ohio, the remaining Spring semester of school post-spring break with no return to NYC, I found myself strongly motivated to continue my routine of studying and practicing. However, starting in July, motivation levels fluctuated constantly. One day I’d be extremely hard working and practice for 6 hours, the next day, none at all. Of course, maintaining an active and healthy lifestyle is crucial. Staying active and focusing on indoor workouts if there are no open fields to go to are major sources of sanity for our brain. Of course staying active and eating requires another level of motivation and dedication. For now, I will focus on the practicing elements related to audition repertoire.",
      "Really evaluate what you genuinely enjoy and whether something is truly worth setting aside time for, whether it’s for a long term goal, or for pure pleasure. When I found myself in deep slumps of unproductivity, I found that looking for pieces that I truly loved and enjoyed playing were really motivating. I decided to make a list on my “day off” of all the pieces that I really loved playing or really wanted to learn. This resulted in my creation of my project “Hidden Gems” (located in the Projects tab). I reached out to a pianist colleague of mine and thankfully she agreed to work on this project with me virtually through sending recordings back and forth before recording a final edition. This project was my form of “coming back” into a driven mode. If I had not practiced for a few days due to laziness, I would listen to recordings of these pieces, and unpack my instrument to play around. While playing around, I would feel very passionate about the piece and have many personal ideas on style and phrasing. Of course, because I hadn’t practiced diligently, my technique was lacking in order to portray my ideas. With that in mind, my motivation fluctuated back up because of my eagerness to portray my ideas. In a way, my project “Hidden Gems” is evidence of my constant fluctuating and return to consistency. Even though my long term plans involve fine detailed work for my audition repertoire, still prioritizing time to make music that you truly feel passionate about is crucial. Yes, the audition repertoire is a priority and it’s important to focus a lot of time and attention on polishing those works and taking the time to digest the repertoire. During this process however, there are times that feel dull. It’s nearly impossible to love all genres. There will come a time in which you must learn a specific piece that you don’t particularly feel connected to. It’s the same as differing personalities. All repertoire have certain personalities to them, and not all will be suited to your particular style of playing. Don’t be discouraged. Knowing yourself and still focusing on those pieces is of course important. Keep an open mind and allow those differing personalities to fill your mind as an actor/actress would. But really ask yourself what pieces are YOU. In those times where you find yourself learning pieces that you don’t particularly love, set aside some time to reinforce your love and passion of music with your own playlist of “Hidden Gems.” Even just 5 minutes of either listening to part of that piece, or playing through it during a break. Your mind will thank you.",
      "I highly encourage you all to take the time to evaluate what you enjoy and have plans to overcome hardships and declines in motivation. It may be difficult to stay consistent, but that’s human nature. And given the current situation, it’s even more difficult to return to daily life and consistency. We all have our list of “Hidden Gems.” Find yours and return to your roots during those moments.",

    body: [
      "What a time to be alive… a truly unexpected situation. I hope everyone is staying safe and finding ways to stay motivated at work and exploring new extracurriculars with “more time on our hands.” Of course, front-line health-care workers don’t have this luxury or dilemma--whichever is the case for you-- of having more time to ourselves. We are forever grateful to those tackling this pandemic head-on and spending countless hours assisting those in need. 💙",
      "This post pertains to my experience thus far and how I’ve coped with this concept of “more time.” I’ve definitely had my fair share of unproductive and dark moments. Luckily, my personality as an introvert hasn’t had too much difficulty with the concept of staying home and minimizing social contact since I was pretty much a hermit crab 🐚🦀prior to this pandemic. However, all humans need social interactions, and of course I miss hanging out with friends and grabbing nice meals in the city. Even more so, as a musician, the concept of collaboration and performing chamber music -- my biggest passion has been completely put on pause. When there’s no upcoming deadline or performance, it’s difficult to remain motivated.  After all, we’re deadline driven beings -- or so we like to think.",
      "From my experience, coming home for a Spring Break that never really ended, called for apartment packing and moving out of the city, all from the comfort of my home back in Ohio. I am so thankful to all my friends and loved ones for their help and selfless generosity in helping me pack and move out of my NYC apartment without having to move at all myself! I’m incredibly lucky. You know who you all are 😘 Anyways, once I got all that situated, of course the academic year wasn’t quite over yet, so I continued to stay motivated simply because I had to. There were still jury recordings due, weekly private lessons, my own private teaching, schoolwork, and finals. Of course I was devastated that my initial summer music festival plans were cancelled and there was no word of changing to a virtual platform. I simply ignored that and continued my own practice for personal growth as a musician. Those elements kept me sane and quite frankly, oblivious to what was happening around the world. Dwelling too much on world events can weigh you down emotionally. In times like this, I find that acknowledging those hardships worldwide and doing your part to stay safe and protect those around you is the best we can do. By doing our own job of staying safe and healthy individually, we will make a greater impact",
      "Post spring break, I surprisingly kept my routine from the online semester probably due to the momentum of school work. However, once mid July came around…. 😳 It was a battle between my brain telling me to get work done, and my wandering thoughts of sleeping in more or watching another episode on Netflix… I’m sure that’s familiar to you all.. If not… please share your secret. Obviously, I was conscious of the fact that I wasn’t motivated anymore and lost my passion to get up and practice. Of course I can complain that it’s due to not having any performances and no upcoming collaborations. At that time, that was my “excuse” to watch another episode or sleep in more. Gradually, that weighed on me emotionally and I just didn’t feel good. I’m a very deadline driven person and I need structure, otherwise I become a blob essentially. 🙃",
      "I took matters into my own hands. Yes, I don’t have any concerts or recitals coming up. “What can I do?” I asked myself. “Create your own opportunities!” So I rolled out of bed one day, and contacted a friend who’s a pianist and asked if she would be interested in collaborating virtually. I made a list of all the short pieces I wanted to learn (obviously short romantic works cause I’m all about that 😍😭🥰🥺). That resulted in my “Hidden Gems” project which kept me sane during my moments of laziness. I also decided to focus a lot on Etudes in order to refine my technique. Thankfully, I have many etudes that I love and have always wanted to learn. Now that I have “more time”, I decided to also create my “Etude Studies” project. Of course, these projects aren’t pressed for time, but I’ve used them as a source of motivation whenever I feel unmotivated and simply don’t want to practice my standard audition repertoire.",
      "In addition to creating my own opportunities, I also found ways to “spice up” my life -- through scheduling changes. 😂🤣😂🤣 It's like how we vary our practice routines and designate different techniques for specific repertoire. Sometimes we just need to change things up to keep a creative open mind. This is the same approach one can take with scheduling. Changing even just one small element of the schedule can help. I personally have always created strict timeline schedules that were set by the minute for efficiency. That plan worked for three weekends, followed by continuous slumps. I decided to then vary it to a simple checklist of things to do. I found that as much as it helps to have a strict schedule, we humans still like to be in control. Therefore, having a strict schedule set out for you made me feel hints of rebelliousness 😈 Not only that, but whenever I didn’t follow the schedule I set for myself, I would just feel dreadful. When I adjusted to a simple checklist, I had the freedom to designate my time in the moment without feeling locked up in a specific schedule. Of course, at times, having a strict schedule really helps me stay on track. That’s why I’ve been experimenting with switching up my scheduling method every three weeks or so, simply because by the end of three three weeks, I become lazy again and need a new creative twist to my mindset. Performing a piece the same way all the time can get tiring and you lose a sense of freshness. Same with scheduling. Going about one’s day with the same routine at all times especially during a time in which you can’t have too many activities that allow your mind to deter from daily life, causes dark moments with a loss of focus.",
      "This turned out to be a lot longer than expected 😅, but it’s what I’ve discovered from my experience so far. I’d love to hear how you all have been doing during this time. If you have any insights on this matter, feel free to comment below and share your thoughts. 😊 In the meantime, stay strong and healthy~ 💪🏼",
